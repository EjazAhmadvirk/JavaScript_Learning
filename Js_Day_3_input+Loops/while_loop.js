let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(`Current value of i: ${i}`);
    i++;
}
// This code initializes a variable i to 0 and uses a while loop to print the current value of i
// until i is no longer less than 5. The loop increments i by 1 in each iteration, demonstrating a simple use of a while loop in JavaScript.
